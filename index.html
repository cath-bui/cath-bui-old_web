        <h1>Hello there!</h1>
        <p>My name is Catherine (or Cath for short) and as you can tell, I'm a beginner when it comes to web development.</p>

            <h1 style="color:white"> About Me </h1>
            <p style="color:white"> I’m a biomedical engineering student at the University of Waterloo and I’m incredibly passionate about both the mental health and gaming industry. 
                As a career, I would love to work in either of these industries, helping to either improve mental health care accessibility or improve gameplay for players. 
                My skillset is more mechanically and electrically inclined, but I also enjoy completing UI/UX projects and am open to software projects as seen by this website. </p>
        
            <p style="color:white"> My experiences have allowed me to try many disciplines such as <b> IT servicing, IoT development, mechanical design, electrical/hardware design,
                basic firmware development, simple Python programming, machine learning techniques (data science) </b> , and my specialty which is <b> program/project management.</b> </p>

            <p style="color:white"> In the future, I would love to pursue more UI/UX design or hardware development, and am looking for opportunities that will help me to hone these skillsets.</p>

            <p style="color:white"> Other than that, I am an advocate for mental health, occasionally working as part of the University of Waterloo's MATES program that helps to support students
                who have troubles and wish to speak about them with someone anonymously. I also particularly enjoy video games such as Valorant, Genshin Impact, Baldur's Gate 3, and Dungeons & Dragons 
                with other games played casually such as Cities Skylines and Civilization V.</p>

      <div>
        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>Throughout my semesters at the University of Waterloo, I've done several different projects that have allowed me to hone my skills and practice engineering given the knowledge
            I had at the time. Here are some of the projects I've worked on!</p>

      <div class="project-ribbon">
        <h1>Self-made Website</h1>
        <p> From scratch, I coded this website using HTML/CSS code from GitHub's free GitHub pages. I first wireframed the la yout on Figma which can be seen just to the side over here. 
            Completing this project allowed me to practice my wireframing skills, making aesthetic and important UI/UX decisions, as well as improve my software development skills. <p>
