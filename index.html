       <p>My name is Catherine (or Cath for short) and as you can tell, I'm a beginner when it comes to web development.</p>

            <h1 style="color:white"> About Me </h1>
            <p style="color: white"> I’m a biomedical engineering student at the University of Waterloo and I’m incredibly passionate about both the mental health and gaming industry. 
                As a career, I would love to work in either of these industries, helping to either improve mental health care accessibility or improve gameplay for players. 
                My skillset is more mechanically and electrically inclined, but I also enjoy completing UI/UX projects and am open to software projects as seen by this website. </p>
        
            <p style="color:white"> My experiences have allowed me to try many disciplines such as IT servicing, IoT development, mechanical design, electrical/hardware design,
                basic firmware development, simple Python programming, machine learning techniques (data science), and my specialty which is program/project management. </p>
